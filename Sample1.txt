Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
Arthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term “Machine Learning” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed “. However, there is no universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently. We give below two more definitions.
* Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain knowledge from data.
* The field of study known as machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience.
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance in tasks through experience. These algorithms and models are designed to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit instructions. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labelled data, while unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabelled data. Reinforcement learning involves training a model through trial and error. Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms  use historical data as input to predict new output values.
